Dan's development blog.. 

I'm intertested in scala, web development, linux, AI, statistics, data mining, genetic programming, open source and plenty of other nerdy things.

These pages were created using a modified form of <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a> -- many thanks to @mdo for the work.
